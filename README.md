## Abstract
NeuroGenesis introduces a novel approach to neural network design inspired by biological neurogenesis, enabling self-evolving architectures that adapt their structure based on learning dynamics. This project implements a meta-learning framework where neural networks can grow, prune, and reorganize themselves during training, leading to more efficient and adaptive models.

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/boyyey/NeuroGenesis.git
cd NeuroGenesis

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv neurogenesis_env
source neurogenesis_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\neurogenesis_env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start
```python
from neurogenesis.core.controller import MetaController
from neurogenesis.core.learner import NeuralLearner

# Initialize the meta-controller and learner
controller = MetaController()
learner = NeuralLearner(input_shape=(784,), num_classes=10)

# Start the self-evolving training
best_model = controller.evolve(learner, X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val)
```

## Architecture
NeuroGenesis consists of three main components:
1. **Learner**: Standard neural network that performs the main learning task
2. **Meta-Controller**: Monitors performance and makes structural decisions
3. **Evolution Engine**: Implements the growth, pruning, and mutation operations

## Features
- Dynamic architecture modification during training
- Adaptive learning rate and optimization strategies
- Memory-efficient growth and pruning
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Comprehensive visualization tools

## Research Paper
This project is based on the research paper "NeuroGenesis: A Self-Evolving Neural Architecture Inspired by Biological Neuroplasticity" by Amir Hossein Rasti. The full paper is available in the `papers/` directory.

## Results
Our experiments demonstrate that NeuroGenesis can:
- Achieve 98.7% accuracy on MNIST with 40% fewer parameters
- Adapt to concept drift in streaming data
- Maintain stable learning over extended training periods
- Outperform static architectures in continual learning scenarios
